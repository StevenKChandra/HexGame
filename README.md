# HexGame
This is an implementation of **Hex** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) built using **C++**

To play, **compile** the code and **run** the executable file. You will be asked to **select** the **size** of the board you are playing and whether you want to play versus AI (**single-player**) or play versus someone else (**2-player local** using the same machine).
On your turn, specify your move by typing an **input** in the form of **column, row**.
